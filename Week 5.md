# Week 5

## Token Ring MAU
- Refers to the portion of the circuitry in a hub, Ethernet switch, or NIC that enables the correct form of electrical connection to the particular type of media being used. iT detects the carrier and signal activity on the media, notes when collisions occur, and forwards this information to the remaining circuitry. 
- MAU's can be connected with Ring-in and Ring-out connectors.
- Layer 1

## Ethernet Hub
- To extend past the maximum length of an Ethernet Bus, you can utilize a repeater. 
- Refers to a multi-port repeater station. It's main service is to connect multiple Ethernet devices together and make them act as single network segment.
- Layer 1

## Bridge
- Refers to a single, aggregate network from multiple communication networks or network segments. AKA, a bridge is a network expansion. It stores the MAC address of devices available in a network.
- One of the main functions of the bridge is to reduce network traffic. Another function is to reduce collisions. 
- Layer 2

## Switch
- Refers to a multi-port bridge. It connects devices on a network by using packet switching to receive and forward data to the destination device. AKA, it uses MAC addresses to forward data at the data link layer.
- Unlike an Ethernet Hubs, which broadcast the same data out of each port and let the devices pick out the data addressed to them, a network switch learns the identities of connected devices and then only forwards data to the port connected to the device to which it is addressed. 
- Layer 2

## Frame
- Refers to the unit of data used to help identify data packets used in networking and telecommunications structures. Frames also help to determine how data receivers interpret a stream of data from a source.
