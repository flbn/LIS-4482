# LIS 4482 Notes

By no means comprehensive, just whatever I felt like was important enough to write down. Feel free to add a PR, including your own notes.

## Dependencies

Uhh, markdown? I think markdown is universal? I don't think you have to install anything other than maybe some extensions to your favorite IDE (for syntax highlighting and previewing). If you don't know how it works, [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) has a pretty guide on how to understand and use it. It's just shortcuts that transpile into HTML.
