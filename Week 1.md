# Week 1

## Structure of Data Communication
-  A Data Communication system is composed of three elements: a source of data, a communication channel, and a receiver.
- Source:
	- Refers to whoever is sending the correspondence.
- Communication Channel: 
	- Refers to either:
		-  A physical transmission medium.
			-  Ex. A wire.
		-  A logical connection over a multiplexed medium.
			-   Ex. A radio channel in telecommunications and computer networking.
- Receiver: 
	- Refers to whoever is receiving the correspondence.

## Signal loss
- Amplifying mends signal loss due to distance
- Daisy Chaining: 

## Noise
- Refers to anything which blocks between message source and destination.
- Noise can lead to the inconsistency of information between source and destination.

## Entropy
- Refers to unknown information moving from sender to receiver.

## Redundancy
- Refers to repetitive information moving from sender to receiver.
